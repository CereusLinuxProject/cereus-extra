# cereus-extra
Cereus Linux repositories mirror. 
Due to GitHub file size limitations, packages above 100MB size aren't available here: onlyoffice-desktopeditors, heroic-bin, brave-bin (packages saved in LFS seems to not be downloadable by XBPS).
You only should use this mirror if you're ok with that and you're not going to use those packages.
